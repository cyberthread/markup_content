# Exercise: Markup Content
This exercise is the opportunity to practice writing semantic HTML. The content you have for this exercise is an excerpt about handwashing from the CDC (which is a governmental website in the US). For this assignment you'll need to use all of the following tags:

- html (don't forget to specify the language)
- head
- title
- meta (both character set and viewport)
- body
- main
- a
- h1
- h2
- p
- ul
- ol
- li

Not sure what one of the tags is? Use the [Mozilla Developer's Network HTML elements Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) to look them up.

## Requirements
- [ ] Accurate and semantic markup of content
- [ ] Contextual and clickable hyperlinks (this will require a slight re-writing of a small portion of the content)
- [ ] Valid code (use the [W3C Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) take a screenshot)
- [ ] Make the webpage live
